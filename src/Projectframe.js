Meditation, connecting with the ocean/nature through surfing and creative expression
through drawing and painting have all been useful tools for me in dealing with mental health.
DRIFT LUMBER
After surfing at local beaches in the San Luis Obispo County area I sometimes see and
pick up drift lumber that has been washed by the ocean, just as I have been. These pieces
of man made wood are usually beat up, worn and would otherwise be disregarded by a
passerby. They aren’t aesthetically “pretty” or perfect. They are each unique and have
value just because of their texture, patterns of grain, locations or times they were picked
from or the story of both the wood’s and my journey to meet and where we both might be
going. These pieces don’t need my art to have value, but other people would possibly not
value them unless they are altered, put in a different context or beautified.
Inspired by the Zen practice of Enso I draw circles or patterns (usually in gold surrounded
by black) on these pieces of drift lumber in a meditation state paying attention to my
thoughts as I paint.
10% of sales of drift lumber will be donated to the
Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary (chumashsanctuary.com)
METAMORPH: COGNITIVE DISTORTIONS
The second edition of the Metamorph coloring book continues the mandala theme
visualizing 15 cognitive distortions. It’s intent is to give a tool for meditation in identifying
thought patterns that might not be wanted.
WHAT ARE COGNITIVE DISTORTIONS?
Distortions are ways that our mind convinces us of something that isn’t really true. These
inaccurate thoughts are usually used to reinforce negative thinking or emotions We tell
ourselves things that sound rational and accurate, but really only serve to keep us feeling
bad about ourselves. Psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck laid the groundwork for the study of these
distortions, and his student David D. Burns continued research on the topic. Challenging
and changing cognitive distortions is a key element of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).</p>
